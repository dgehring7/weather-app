This is my first attempt at my weather app. I know its not finished, but I will keep working on it until it is.
What is supposed to happen is as soon as the page starts it checks for any local storage
Then the user searches for a city, and the current weather with temperature, wind speed, humidity, and UV index should appear
Using an API call the app recieves the current weather parameters and displays them on the page
Also, the 5 day forcast with the same parameters as before should appear for the selected city
The previously searched cities should be stored in local storage and be available to click on again
